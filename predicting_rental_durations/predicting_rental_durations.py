#  In this project, you will use regression models to predict the number of days a customer rents DVDs for.
#
#  As with most data science projects, you will need to pre-process the data provided, in this case, a csv file called
#  rental_info.csv. Specifically, you need to:
#
#  - Read in the csv file rental_info.csv using pandas.
#  - Create a column named "rental_length_days" using the columns "return_date" and "rental_date", and add it to the
#    pandas DataFrame. This column should contain information on how many days a DVD has been rented by a customer.
#  - Create two columns of dummy variables from "special_features", which takes the value of 1 when:
#    - The value is "Deleted Scenes", storing as a column called "deleted_scenes".
#    - The value is "Behind the Scenes", storing as a column called "behind_the_scenes".
#  - Make a pandas DataFrame called X containing all the appropriate features you can use to run the regression models,
#    avoiding columns that leak data about the target.
#  - Choose the "rental_length_days" as the target column and save it as a pandas Series called y.
#
#  Following the preprocessing you will need to:
#
#  - Split the data into X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test train and test sets, avoiding any features that leak data
#    about the target variable, and include 20% of the total data in the test set.
